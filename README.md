# Quantum-Reinforcement-Learning
Implementation of proof of concept quantum enhanced reinforced learning algorithm, able to find the sequence of quantum gates needed to approximate a given function.

The algorithm is still under development for my Master Thesis Project at Politecncio di Torino. I am planning to complete it in the next weeks / few months, I'll keep this README updated.  

At the moment, the algorithm works correctly, I am working to implement systematic experiments to be statistically significant. All tests on a pair (initial_state, terminal_state) are repeated using [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) framework to check for correctness.
